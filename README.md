Virtualization: Companies used to have more number of datacenters and they were costly and has more capacity. If only one app is running, then there will be wastage of resources on server. So using virtualization we can create multiple virtual servers and we can launch mutiple virtual machines and run multiple apps on the same server.
So you are renting it from cloud.
