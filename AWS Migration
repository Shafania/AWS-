## AWS Migration Hub

What it is: A central dashboard that helps you track and manage the migration of your applications to AWS.
Example: Imagine you’re moving several applications from your company’s data center to AWS. AWS Migration Hub helps you see the progress of each migration in one place, ensuring you don’t lose track of any application.
AWS Application Discovery Service

What it is: A tool that helps you discover details about your on-premises applications, such as their dependencies and performance.
Example: Before migrating a web application to AWS, you use this service to find out which databases, servers, and network configurations it depends on. This information helps you plan the migration more effectively.
AWS Database Migration Service (DMS)

What it is: A service that helps you migrate databases to AWS with minimal downtime.
Example: Your company’s customer database is on an on-premises MySQL server. Using DMS, you can migrate this database to Amazon RDS (a cloud database service) without significant downtime, so your users can continue accessing the database during the migration.
AWS Server Migration Service (SMS)

What it is: A service that automates the migration of on-premises servers to AWS.
Example: You have several physical servers running your company’s internal applications. Using AWS SMS, you can create virtual machine images of these servers and move them to AWS, turning them into Amazon EC2 instances (virtual servers in the cloud).
AWS DataSync

What it is: A service that simplifies and accelerates moving large amounts of data between on-premises storage and AWS storage services.
Example: You have a massive amount of data stored in a local NAS (Network-Attached Storage) system. AWS DataSync can help you quickly and securely transfer this data to Amazon S3 (AWS's object storage service).
CloudEndure Migration

What it is: A tool that automates the rehosting of applications by replicating entire applications and their data to AWS.
Example: You want to move a complex application that runs on multiple servers with various configurations to AWS. CloudEndure Migration replicates the entire setup (servers, databases, etc.) to AWS, so you don’t have to reconfigure everything manually.
